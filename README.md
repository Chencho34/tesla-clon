## Project Create With React App and Redux

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), using the [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) and [Redux Toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/) template.

## Description

This project is a clone of Tesla's home page, created to replicate its user interface. It is styled using Styled Components, a library that allows writing styles directly into React components, making design development and maintenance easier. Additionally, React Reveal has been implemented for animations that enhance the presentation of the components, providing an attractive visual experience.

The design highlights with a drop-down menu for a better user experience.
